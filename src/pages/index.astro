			<p class=" text-base text-grey-500 leading-relaxed">ART, in itself is one of the most hard and thought provoking creative that everyone has and lost growing up. and here I'll share my journey of becoming a person who makes art.</p>
			<p class=" text-base text-grey-500 leading-relaxed">Through my drawings, I aim to capture and express a wide range of emotions, embracing the beauty of human vulnerability and the complexities of our inner worlds.</p>
			<p class=" text-base text-grey-500 leading-relaxed">I hope i can create thoughtful artworks which has an inherent meaning for both myself and others. I think my vision of what i want to do with my art will keep evolving as iam learning more and more of life in itself. But as for now check out my drawings. Enjoy ðŸ™‚</p>

So, I started a account in few social medias and started posting. It's been a wonderfully painfull journey of learning till now and iam extreamly happy that i got to draw for all this time. Sttill love drawing and making Videos, but don't want to make anything just for the sake of doing it. Wanting to start creating art and short films for the passion of doing so.</p>

I know! we all have been there. and i also remember me not winning the competition and came back home to get angry over the family members that i can't able to win the competition.
