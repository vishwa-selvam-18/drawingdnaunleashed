                    <p class="Brief1 leading-relaxed">Artisverything is a blog website for one of my peers. He is a really good writer who has a passion in creating things and especially writing. He asked me if I can design a website for him where he can write and post about his other projects as well. The idea behind the design is something that is very simple  yet looks good and really functional. The fonts are coosen for good readeblity and the colours are inspired from Michelangelo's sculptures</p>
                    <p class="Brief2 Leaading-relaxed">The idea of getting colour inspiration is completely the other guys idea as he is intrested and facinated by those very much. Rest of all things comes down just to a minmal good looking site yet fades away as the visitor focuses on the blog and indulging themself in the process of reading it. So that it wont be in their way, creating a good experience for reading as thats what we want this webste to be visited</p>

                    <p class="Brief1 leading-relaxed">Started creating this app in a request from one my peers. Took it as an oppurtunity to learn more on UI Design. Spent well over 60 to 80 hours on it. Pretty happy with the results at that time. Yet an unfinished project as i never got to design the employer side application :)</p>
                    <p class="Brief2 leading-relaxed">The Objective is to create an mobile application that works as a single place to monitor their daily visits, Orders taken, Progress of the ordes, Products, Setting Appointments, Handling attendance and Leave applys and related things. An overall applicatoin for an employee to track and moniotr everythig he do so that it would be easy for both the business and the employee to carryouot the operations.</p>
                    <p class="Brief3 leading-relaxed">Thinking of creating seperate sections for having the whole project up here but don't have enough time to do so ðŸ˜….</p>
